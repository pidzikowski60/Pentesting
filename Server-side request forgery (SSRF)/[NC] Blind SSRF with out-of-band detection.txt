This site uses analytics software which fetches the URL specified in the Referer header when a product page is loaded.

To solve the lab, use this functionality to cause an HTTP request to the public Burp Collaborator server.

1. Włączamy strone z zadaniem i uruchamiamy burpa, włączamy intercepta i klikamy kategorie, przechywcone połączenie wysyłamy do repetera, wyłączamy intercepta 
2. Wchodzimy w burp collaborator, kopiujemy link w podobie jak sahbyqi1y21jhndbjhkqsbdh1ghj13n1.burpcollaborator.net i podmieniamy go w referer
3. Do referera dopisujemy http://(link) Klikamy send i wracamy do burp collaborator, klikamy pull now i mamy pingi 


ENG:

1.Visit a product, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
2.Go to the Repeater tab. Select the Referer header, right-click and select "Insert Collaborator Payload" to replace the original domain with a Burp Collaborator generated domain. Send the request.
3.Go to the Collaborator tab, and click "Poll now". If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again, since the server-side command is executed asynchronously.
4.You should see some DNS and HTTP interactions that were initiated by the application as the result of your payload.
